# Angular Code
#### Installation
* Clone the repo
* You are in project root now
* Run command `npm install` (Node and NPM is required)
* After installing node modules run command `bower install` (bower is required  if not exist then `npm i bower -g` will install bower)
* Run command `npm start`
* Goto browser and hit url `http://localhost3000`, (i Hope port 3000 is free, if its not running on 3000 then you can see on terminal on which address it can be accessed)
